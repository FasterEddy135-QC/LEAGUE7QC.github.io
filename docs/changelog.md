We are almost ready to initialize LEAGUE7! With the [recent official updates](https://x.com/QuidditchGame/status/1827115334001721359) from Quidditch Champions, I am super excited. I had to change some of the structural things in the guidelines to keep it fresh and aligned with the recent news, and I think this version became super fun! Here is the list of all the news:
### Added
- 🧙‍♂️ Registration Forms: Forms are ready! Sign up for the Tryout Season and let's keep the heat on!
- 🔍 Tryout Season: A way to compete with your individual skills in this preparation period
- 🏆 Triwizard Tournament: A rare and thrilling event for the best of the bests!

### Changed
- 👑 Presidents can now be part of a team under strict limitations (requested by community)
- 📜 Renamed "Gameplay Guidelines" to "Regular Seasonal Guidelines" for clarity
- 🗑️ Removed biannual seasonal structure
- 🗓️ Seasons now align with official Quidditch Champions timelines
- 🦉 Phase 1 (Points-based Ranking) is now O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels)
