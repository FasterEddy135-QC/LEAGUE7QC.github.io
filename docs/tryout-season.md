## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the LEAGUE7 Tryout Season! 

This exciting period is designed for players to showcase their individual skills in a fun and friendly environment. It's a preparation for the real season, aimed at creating friendships and encouraging communication within our community. This season is built on trust and provides an opportunity for players to demonstrate their abilities across all roles.

## 2. Season Structure

### 2.1 Duration
- The Tryout Season will last for 7 weeks.
- **Registration is currently open**. (see <span style="color:#ffbd00">[Registration](registration.md)</span>)
- Key dates:
    - Registration deadline: September 23, 2024 (subject to change)
    - Tryout Season start date: October 7, 2024 (subject to change)

### 2.2 Schedule
- Match timing will be arranged by players themselves with their assigned observers (see Section 4).
- All matches MUST be played during the following designated peak hours:
  - Weekdays: 6pm - 10pm local time
  - Weekends: 2pm - 10pm local time
  - These peak hours are mandatory to ensure fair queue times and balanced matchmaking for all participants.
- Players must coordinate with their assigned observers to schedule matches within these strict time frames.
- No matches are allowed outside of these designated peak hours unless explicitly authorized by staff due to exceptional circumstances.
- If a player cannot participate during these peak hours due to persistent conflicts, they must contact staff immediately to discuss their situation and potential solutions.
- Players must submit scores for 1 match per week.

## 3. Player Registration

### 3.1 Process
- Players must register using the Tryout Season Registration Form.
- During registration, players will select their primary role (Seeker, Chaser, Beater, or Keeper).
- Players may also indicate a secondary role, but evaluation will focus on their primary role.

## 4. Pairing System

### 4.1 Mutual Observation
- All players participating in the Tryout Season will serve as both players and observers within their chosen role.
- Each week, players will be **randomly** paired with another participant who plays the same role (e.g., Seekers with Seekers, Chasers with Chasers, etc.).
- Players from EU and NA regions will be paired within their respective regions to ensure compatible time zones and reduce latency issues.
- In each pair, both individuals will play their own matches and observe their partner's matches (see Section 5).
- When observing, players are responsible for watching their partner's matches in their shared role and verifying the results.
- Players are expected to uphold the integrity of the competition both when playing and when observing their role counterparts.

### 4.2 Weekly Rotation
- Pairings will change every week to ensure fairness, variety, and to prevent any potential bias.
- No player will be paired with the same observer more than once during the Tryout Season, unless absolutely necessary due to participant numbers in their role.

### 4.3 Scheduling
- Players must coordinate with their assigned partner to schedule both their own matches and the matches they will observe.
- All matches must be scheduled within the allowed time frames.

### 4.4 Conflict Resolution
- If any conflicts or disagreements arise between paired players, they must report to the staff immediately.
- In such cases, staff can either assign a new partner from the same role or choose to observe the matches themselves to mediate any disputes.
- Any attempts to manipulate the system or collude will result in disqualification from the Tryout Season.
- In the event of an odd number of participants in a role, one player each week may be paired with a staff member or a designated neutral observer for that role.

## 5. Match Format

### 5.1 Queue System
- Players will enter a solo queue for their primary role.
- Matches will be formed with random teammates and opponents.
- Players must share their screen with their assigned observer during the matches.

### 5.2 Match Structure
- Players can choose to play a single game or a best-of-three series.
- Players are free to use any in-game settings or strategies allowed by the official game.
- No additional restrictions will be imposed by the league after season starts.

## 6. Scoring System

### 6.1 Base Scoring
- Players earn points based on badges achieved in each match:
  - Bronze Badge: 25 points
  - Silver Badge: 50 points
  - Gold Badge: 100 points
  - Platinum Badge: 250 points
- Detailed definition for badges will be announced after the game's release and before the season starts.

### 6.2 Role-Specific Bonuses
- Additional points are awarded for key performance indicators in each role.
- Detailed bonus point allocations will be announced after the game's release and before the season starts.
- *For example*, faster snitch catch time will provide a bonus for Seekers.

### 6.3 Opponent Adjustment Factor
- Scores are adjusted based on the strength of opponents faced, calculated using relevant opposing team badges.
- *For example*, a potential calculation for Seeker: 
    - Adjustment Factor = 1 + (0.1 * number of opposing Beater's *Knock out Seekers* badges) + (0.05 * number of opposing Seeker's *Bump* badges)
    - Adjusted Score = (Base Score + Role-Specific Bonuses) * Adjustment Factor
- Detailed formulation will be announced after the game's release and before the season starts.


## 7. Reporting and Verification

### 7.1 Match Reporting
- Reporting will be done in agreement with the assigned observer.
- A standardized form must be completed, detailing badges earned and relevant opponent badges.

### 7.2 Dispute Resolution
- If any problems occur between the player and observer, they must request a staff member to observe the games as well.

### 7.3 Missed Matches
- If a player is unable to complete their weekly match due to unforeseen circumstances they must notify their assigned observer and a staff member as soon as possible.
- The player will be allowed to make up the missed match in the following week, in addition to that week's regular match.
- A maximum of two make-up matches will be allowed per season.
- Failure to complete matches without proper notification may result in a score of zero for that week.

### 7.4 Weekly Ranking
- Reported results will be collected by staff and added to the rankings as they are submitted.
- Updated rankings will be published regularly throughout the week.


## 8. Post-Season

### 8.1 Role Rankings
- At the end of the 7-week period, final rankings will be published for each role.
- Rankings will be based on the cumulative adjusted scores over the entire Tryout Season.

    - Highest single-week adjusted score
    - Total number of Platinum badges earned
    - Total number of Gold badges earned
