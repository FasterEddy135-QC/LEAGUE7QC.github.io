# Holidays At L7: Mystery Draft Tournament üéÅ

No pressure, no expectations - just good times with good company. Bring your holiday spirit and sense of adventure as we close out the year with this festive celebration of Quidditch!

## The Mystery Draft System 

### Captain Selection
- Beater positions will serve as team captains
- Number of captains will be determined by final participant count (4-8 captains)
- Captain positions assigned based on application timestamp

### Draft Process
Our holiday-themed draft event incorporates a unique "present box" system:

1. Players will be sorted into *mystery present boxes*
2. During the draft round, captains can either:
   - Select from previously revealed players
   - Unwrap a new mystery box and select one player from it

**Example Draft Round:**
1. Captain 1 unwraps Present Box 1
   - Three players are revealed
   - Captain selects one player
2. Captain 2's turn:
   - Can choose from the two remaining revealed players
   - OR unwrap a new present box (must select from new box if opened)
3. Process continues until all players are drafted

## Important Notes
- Players must be available for the full duration of the event
- Check-in required 30 minutes before draft begins, late arrivals will not be accommodated once the draft begins
- All tournament communication will be conducted through the #mystery-draft channel
- Each team will be assigned a private text channel after the draft
