# 5v5 Dream Tournament üèÜ 

LEAGUE7 presents our most competitive tournament yet, where standardized loadouts and reduced team sizes will separate the truly skilled from the rest. No fancy brooms or optimized builds to hide behind‚Äîjust pure talent and teamwork in this high-stakes competition!

This tournament will not be for the faint-of-heart, made to test the mettle of each and every participant, ensuring that their hard-earned-skill and natural-born-talent is brought to the forefront. This effective 'Hard Mode' will establish a standard broom and skill-tree build for each role, making sure everyone is on equal footing with only their abilities to separate them!
