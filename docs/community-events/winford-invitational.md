## Winford Invitational

As LEAGUE7, we are excited to support the **Winford Invitational** as an exciting community-driven 2v2 tournament event! While this is not an official LEAGUE7 tournament, we're collaborating to help bring this event to life in response to the community's interest in diverse competitive experiences in Quidditch Champions. 

Before you jump into details, we want to clarify the following key points:
- As an independently run event, Winford will be primarily responsible for tournament operations and issue resolution.
- LEAGUE7's role is to provide logistical support and a community platform.
- We're working closely with Winford to ensure the best possible experience for all participants, while keeping to his requested event timeline.
- This collaboration serves as a valuable opportunity for us to gather insights that will help improve future events and league operations.

We appreciate your understanding and enthusiasm as we explore new ways to enhance the competitive Quidditch Champions scene. Your participation and feedback are crucial, and we'll use this experience to refine our approach to community events moving forward.
