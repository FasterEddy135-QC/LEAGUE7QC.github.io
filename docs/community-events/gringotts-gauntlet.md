# The Gringotts Gauntlet
*No Galleons, No Glory.*

Gather your grit, grab your gear, and get ready to gamble your fate in League7’s most gloriously goblin-approved tournament yet. 

Welcome to the Gringotts Gauntlet — a gleaming gamble of gold, glory, and the great unknown. 

This two-day auction draft tournament tasks captains with bidding for their rosters using a limited stash of galleons. With strategy, timing, and a bit of magic, you’ll build your team from a vault of hopefuls. But spend wisely — once your gold is gone, it’s gone.

## Rules & Details

### Initial Setup
- All standard LEAGUE7 rules, game rules, and [Code of Ethics](/codeofethics) apply
- Event requires 24+ player sign-ups to proceed
    - Minimum 4 teams, maximum 8 teams
    - Each team consists of 1 captain + 5 players (6 total)
- Each captain begins the draft with a 2,500 galleon budget to bid on players.  
- All bidding takes place in real-time within the designated Discord channel.
    - Discord participation is required for all players

### Nomination & Draft Process  
- Captains will take turns nominating a player for auction. The nomination order is randomized at the start of the draft.  
- Captains have 60 seconds to **nominate a player** 
  - Failure to nominate within time limit results in 100 galleon penalty for each delay.
- Once a player is nominated, a 60-second **bidding window** begins.  
  - Bids must increase by increments of 100 galleons.  
  - The highest valid bid at the end of the timer wins the player.  
- A valid bid is the first timestamped bid that is at least 100 galleons more than the previous one. 
  - Process will be streamed and the streamer's Discord window determines the final state of the bids.
  - Bids lower than the current highest are invalid and ignored.  
- If no bids are placed, the nominating captain purchases the player for 100 galleons.  
- Captains must always retain 100 galleons per remaining open roster slot.  
  - Example: If a captain has 4 empty spots, they must have at least 400 galleons remaining.  
- Once a captain fills their 6-player roster, they no longer bid or nominate.

### Draft Completion 
- The draft ends when all captains have completed their rosters.  
- Unselected players will not be assigned to any team.  
- Tournament staff hold final say in all disputes or rule clarifications.
