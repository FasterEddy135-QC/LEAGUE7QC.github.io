# FAQ

> ### How many players can be on a team?
Each team must have a minimum of 3 players. This minimum number may be increased following announcements from Quidditch Champions. There is no specified maximum in the guidelines, however, we suggest having at least 2 additional players per team to account for potential scheduling problems. This means a recommended team size would be 5-7 players.

> ### Can we add or remove players from our team during the season?
No, you cannot add or remove players from your once a season has started. However, in emergency situations, changes might be considered at the discretion of the staff and Captains' Council. These situations would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and any changes would require approval from both the staff and the Captains' Council. It's important to build a roster with enough players to account for potential absences or issues throughout the season.

> ### Can we swap players in a best-of-3 games?
No substitutions are allowed during a *single* game. Once a game starts, that lineup must remain unchanged unless there's a technical issue as outlined in the substitution rules. However, there are no limits on player changes between games in the series. This means you can freely adjust your lineup after each game.

> ### I don't have a team. Can I still parcipitate?
LEAGUE7 does not have an individual player setup. However, you can use the #looking-for-players channel in our Discord server to connect with other players and form a team. This is a great way to find teammates if you're not already part of a team.
