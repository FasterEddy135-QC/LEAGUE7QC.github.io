# FAQ

> ### Can we add or remove players from our team during the season?
No, you cannot add or remove players from your once a season has started. However, in emergency situations, changes might be considered at the discretion of the Staff and Captains' Council. These situations would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and any changes would require approval from both the Staff and the Captains' Council. It's important to build a roster with enough players to account for potential absences or issues throughout the season.

> ### Can we swap players in best-of-3 games?
Substitutions are not allowed during a <i>single</i> game. Once a game starts, that lineup must remain unchanged unless there's a technical issue as outlined in the substitution rules. However, there are no limits on player changes between games in a series. This means you can freely adjust your lineup after each game.

> ### I don't have a team. Can I still participate?
Yes, you can join our Tryout Season! You can also use the #looking-for-players channel in our Discord server to connect with other players and form a team for regular seasons. This is a great way to find teammates if you're not already part of a team. LEAGUE7 does not plan to continue running individual seasons after official seasons have started.

> ### Do teams have to re-apply for each season or do existing teams always exist unless they specifically say they are quitting?
Teams should reapply for each season. This ensures that all participating teams are active and committed to the upcoming season, and allows for any necessary updates to team information or rosters.
