# FAQ

> ### Does a person need to participate in the Tryout Season to participate in the league?
No, participation in the Tryout Season is not mandatory to join the regular league season. The Tryout Season is designed to help players showcase their skills and potentially form teams, but it's not a prerequisite for league participation. Players can join existing teams or form new teams for the regular season without having taken part in the Tryout Season.

> ### How do EU and NA divisions work in LEAGUE7?
EU and NA players are combined into a single pool for the Tryout Season. However, for the regular seasons, EU and NA may split into separate, independent divisions if game provides server selection tools. Each division runs its own O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s phases and crowns its own champion. Currently, registering teams can select either division but must commit to it for the entire season. Mixed EU/NA teams are permitted but must choose one division for competition. This structure balances diverse play during tryouts with convenient match times and fair competition in the regular season.

> ### Can we add or remove players from our team during a regular season?
Normally, you cannot add or remove players once a season has started. For Season 01 only, we allow teams to change their rosters due to uncertainty of the game state. In emergency situations, changes might be considered at the discretion of the Staff and Captains' Council. These situations would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and any changes would require approval from both the Staff and the Captains' Council. It's important to build a roster with enough players to account for potential absences or issues throughout the season.

> ### Can players compete for multiple teams in a season?
No. Once a player is registered with a team for a season, they cannot compete for any other team during that season, even as a substitute. LEAGUE7 does not maintain a general substitute pool. All players must be registered with a specific team at the start of the season and can only play for that team throughout the season (unless transfer occurs). This rule ensures competitive integrity and prevents potential conflicts of interest. Teams are encouraged to register enough players to cover potential absences or issues throughout the season.

> ### How many subs can a team have?
The maximum number of substitutes a team can have is set to 3 for Season 01. When registering for a season, teams provide a full list of all their players without distinguishing between starters and substitutes. As long as all players are registered with the team at the start of the season, any 9 players from that list can play in a match. This flexibility allows teams to manage their rosters effectively throughout the season, accounting for potential absences or tactical changes. 

> ### Can we swap players in best-of-3 games?
Once a game starts, that lineup must remain unchanged unless there's a technical issue as outlined in the rules. However, there are no limits on player changes between games in a series. Substitutions are not allowed during a <i>single</i> game. This means you can freely adjust your lineup after each game.

> ### Do teams have to re-apply for each season or do existing teams always exist unless they specifically say they are quitting?
Teams should reapply for each season. This ensures that all participating teams are active and committed to the upcoming season, and allows for any necessary updates to team information or rosters.
