# FAQ

> ### How many players can be on a team?
Each team must have a minimum of 3 players. This minimum number may be increased following announcements from Quidditch Champions. There is no specified maximum in the guidelines, however, we suggest having at least 2 additional players per team to account for potential scheduling problems. This means a recommended team size would be 5-7 players.

> ### Can we add or remove players from our team during the season?
No, you cannot add or remove players from your once a season has started. However, in emergency situations, changes might be considered at the discretion of the Staff and Captains' Council. These situations would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and any changes would require approval from both the Staff and the Captains' Council. It's important to build a roster with enough players to account for potential absences or issues throughout the season.

> ### Can we swap players in a best-of-3 games?
Substitutions are not allowed during a <i>single</i> game. Once a game starts, that lineup must remain unchanged unless there's a technical issue as outlined in the substitution rules. However, there are no limits on player changes between.ames in the series. This means you can freely adjust your lineup after each game.

> ### I don't have a team. Can I still parcipitate?
LEAGUE7 does not have an individual player setup. However, you can use the #looking-for-players channel in our Discord server to connect with other players and form a team. This is a great way to find teammates if you're not already part of a team.

> ### Do teams have to re-apply for each season or do existing teams always exist unless they specifically say they are quitting?
Teams should reapply for each season. This ensures that all participating teams are active and committed to the upcoming season, and allows for any necessary updates to team information or rosters.

> ### <span style="color:#ffbd00">How about the First Season requirements?</span>
The guidelines are written for an ongoing system. Since we won't have the usual 3-month preparation period and I want to capitalize on the initial excitement, the first season **must be** slightly different. The following adjustments will be made: I, Melanore, will either serve as president myself for the first season, or conduct a quick election just before the season starts. If an election is held (most likely option), it will be limited to individuals who have been active and demonstrated clear communication in the community over the past 3 months. This approach is necessary to get the league started promptly. As I mentioned in the preface, I'm asking for your trust in this initial setup to ensure a smooth launch of LEAGUE7.
