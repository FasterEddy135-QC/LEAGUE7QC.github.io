# Season 2 - Rules & Format (Draft)

> This document outlines league format and new rules for Season 2 **suggested**  by Melanore. These rules build upon the foundation established in Season 1 and incorporate feedback from the community, Staff, and Captains' Council. The finalization of the ruleset will be announced after Presidential elections, by the new President.

> This document is still a DRAFT.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
LEAGUE7 provides a structured competitive environment for Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions players of all skill levels. Building upon our Season 1, Season 2 introduces several key enhancements including,
- A three-tiered division structure (World Cup, Triwizard Cup, and House Cup),  
- Refined roster management with division-specific regulations, and,
- A promotion/relegation system to ensure teams compete at appropriate skill levels. 

These guidelines establish the rules and framework to ensure fair competition while building a strong community that accommodates both highly competitive teams and those developing their skills.

### 1.2 Season Overview
Season 2 introduces a division-based structure to enhance competitive balance and provide appropriate challenges for teams of varying skill levels. The season maintains its two-phase format:
- O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels): Qualifying round using division-based round-robin format
- N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests): Promotion/relegation tournaments between divisions

## 2. Season Timeline

### 2.1 Season Duration
Each season spans approximately three months:
- 2 weeks for team registration and preparation
- 7 weeks for O.W.L.s matches (round-robin format within divisions)
- 2 weeks for N.E.W.T.s matches (promotion/relegation tournaments)

### 2.2 Registration Timeline
- Team registration ends one week before season start
  - This time cannot be shortened to allow time for Captains' Council discussions
- Each team needs:
  - A registered roster meeting all requirements in Section 4
  - Completed registration form with all required information
  - Additional requirements will be listed on registration forms

### 2.3 Minimum Requirements
- Each division will host a maximum of 7 teams
- The league will proceed if at least 5 teams register for each division
- If fewer than 5 teams register for any division by the deadline:
  - A pre-season exhibition period will be held to attract more teams from free agents (maximum 1 week)
  - Staff may adjust division structure or game settings based on registration numbers
- If a team drops out mid-season:
  - All previous matches involving that team will be voided and removed from standings calculations
  - All future scheduled matches will be canceled
  - This ensures fairness if some teams have played the departing team while others have not

## 3. Division Structure

### 3.1 Division Types
Season 2 will feature three divisions based on skill level. The league may operate with two (or four) divisions if registration numbers require it.

#### 3.1.1 World Cup Division
- Top-tier competitive play
- Previous season's highest performers
- Strictest roster regulations

#### 3.1.2 Triwizard Cup Division
- Semi-pro level competitive play
- Balanced skill level
- Moderate roster regulations

#### 3.1.3 House Cup Division
- Entry-pro level competitive play
- Developmental focus, welcoming to new players
- Most flexible roster regulations

### 3.2 Division Assignment
- Teams from Season 1 will be assigned to divisions based on their previous standings
- New teams will be evaluated and placed by Staff
   - If a new team consists of players who participated in previous seasons, their past rankings and performance will be considered in division placement
- Teams may request specific division placement with justification submitted during registration
- If more teams request placement in a division than available slots:
   - Priority given based on previous season's final standings
   - Staff may organize a brief pre-season qualification tournament during the registration period
   - Staff evaluation will consider point differentials, head-to-head records, and roster stability
- Teams may decline to participate if not placed in their preferred division, but must notify Staff within 24 hours of placement notification to allow for adjustments

#### 3.2.1 Division Size and Distribution
- World Cup Division will always maintain exactly 7 teams when possible
- Division distribution based on total team registrations:
  - 14-15 teams: Two divisions of 7 and 8 teams
  - 16-20 teams: World Cup (7 teams), Triwizard Cup (remainder up to 9 teams), House Cup (remainder)
  - 21+ teams: Staff may create an additional division or move excess players to the Free Agent Pool
- If more than 21 teams register, Free Agent Pool usage rules may be updated to accommodate new player entry during the season
- If fewer than 14 teams register, Staff will restructure to two divisions with World Cup maintaining 7 teams when possible 

### 3.3 Team Leadership Structure
- Team ownership and branding rights belong exclusively to the team Captain
  - Established team branding from previous seasons has protected status and cannot be used by new teams without explicit authorization from the original Captain
  - A Captain may transfer branding rights to a new Captain at their discretion

## 5. O.W.L.s Format

### 5.1 Match Format
- Teams play against all other teams in their division (round robin format)
- Each match is best-of-3 games, winning two games secures victory
- Teams have up to 7 weeks to complete all their division matches (they can complete earlier)
- Teams are responsible for scheduling and completing all matches within the timeframe

### 5.2 Match Scheduling
- Team captains are responsible for scheduling their matches within the 7-week timeframe
- Both team captains must confirm schedule agreements in writing on LEAGUE7's official Discord
- Teams are responsible for completing all their matches within the 7-week O.W.L.s period
- No maximum limit on the number of matches teams can play per week
- Teams must complete at least two matches by the end of week 3
- Teams must complete at least four matches (cumulative total) by the end of week 5
- Failure to meet these milestones will automatically trigger the default scheduling mechanism

### 5.2.1 Default Game Times
- Each division has designated default game times each weekend:
  - World Cup Division: Saturday at 12:00 PM PST
  - Triwizard Cup Division: Saturday at 1:00 PM PST
  - House Cup Division: Saturday at 2:00 PM PST
  - These default times remain in place until captains successfully vote on division-specific time
- These default times are automatically scheduled for any unscheduled matches approaching deadlines
- Teams may reschedule from these default times if both captains agree in writing at least 48 hours before the default time
- If a team cannot make their division's default time, they must proactively reach out to schedule an alternative

### 5.2.2 Scheduling Enforcement Process
- If captains fail to respond to scheduling requests for 48 hours (measured from the initial documented scheduling request), Staff will issue a formal scheduling notice
  - Any response indicating intent to schedule (even without specific details) is sufficient
  - This intervention only occurs when captains are completely non-communicative
- If no response is received within 24 hours of the notice:
   - Staff will assign a match time during the upcoming weekend at default game times
   - Teams who fail to appear at the assigned time will forfeit

### 5.2.3 Scheduling Ethics

  - Teams found to be deliberately manipulating the scheduling process will face automatic penalties:
    - First offense: Warning and mandatory default scheduling for next match
    - Second offense: Point deduction equal to one match loss
    - Third offense: Disqualification from current season

### 5.2.5 Broadcast Schedule
- If broadcasting team is available to stream matches during Season 2, a calendar system will be implemented
- Each broadcast slot can accommodate only one match (first come, first served)
- Teams wishing to be featured must reserve a slot through the official reservation system
- Reserved broadcast slots take scheduling priority over default times

### 5.3 Scoring System
- Teams are ranked by match series won
  - Example: Winning a best-of-3 series counts as 1 match win
- When teams have equal match series wins, the following tiebreakers apply in order:
  1. Total game wins: All individual games won across all series
      - *Example:* Team A (2-0, 2-1, 1-2) has 5 game wins
  2. Game Win Rate: (Games Won / Total Games Played) × 100
      - *Example:* Team A won 5 games out of 7 = 71.4%
  3. Point Differential: Sum of all score differences across all games
      - *Example:* Winning games by (+30, +20, -10) = +40 total
- If there is still a tie, Staff will offer resolution options (in order):
  1. Teams available: Play tiebreaker match within 48 hours
  2. Teams agree: Follow captains' mutual decision
  3. No agreement/availability: Staff conducts coin flip

### 5.4 Forfeit Limitations and Tournament Integrity
- Teams found to be strategically forfeiting matches to manipulate tournament seeding will face serious penalties
