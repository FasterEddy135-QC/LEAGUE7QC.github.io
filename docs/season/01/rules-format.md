# Season 01 - Rules & Format

### 1.1 Purpose
LEAGUE7 provides a structured competitive environment for Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions players of all skill levels. These guidelines establish the rules and framework to ensure fair competition while building a strong community.

### 1.2 Season Overview
Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions runs approximately 2-month seasons (estimated based on Season 1 arrival date). LEAGUE7 extends this to trimester-based seasons for more comprehensive competition, while keeping the names in alignment with the official seasons on the start dates.

Each LEAGUE7 season is divided into two phases:
- O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels): Qualifying round using round-robin format
- N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests): Top teams compete in a double-elimination tournament

## 2. Season Timeline

### 2.1 Season Duration
Each season spans approximately three months:
- 2 weeks for team registration and preparation
- 7-15 weeks for O.W.L.s matches (depends on number of registered teams and number of matches per week)
- 2 weeks for N.E.W.T.s matches

### 2.2 Registration Timeline
- Team registration ends one week before season start
  - This time cannot be shortened to allow time for Captains' Council discussions
- Each team needs:
  - A captain who owns team branding rights 
  - A roster of registered players
  - Additional requirements will be listed on registration forms

### 2.3 Minimum Requirements
- The league will officially begin when at least 7 teams have registered to participate
- If 5-7 teams register by the deadline:
  - A pre-season exhibition period will be held to attract more teams
  - This period will last up to 1 month
  - If 7 teams are not registered by the end of this period, the league start will be postponed
- If a team drops out mid-season, all their remaining matches count as forfeits
  - Forfeits are recorded as 2-0 wins for opponents
  - Scoreboard records 0-0 for each forfeited game

## 3. Team Management

### 3.1 Roster Rules
- Roster sizes:
  - Minimum 6 players
  - Maximum 9 players
- Players can only be registered with one team at a time
  - Players cannot be substitutes for other teams
  - Players must complete current season or be formally removed before joining another team
- Teams must maintain minimum roster size throughout season
- Each team player must be available in the official LEAGUE7 Discord server at all times.
- **Season 1 Exception - Roster Adjustments:**
  - Due to game's early state, roster changes are allowed during Season 1
  - Limited to 4 total changes (player addition) after season starts. Player departures do not count as roster changes
  - 48-hour notice required before any new player's first match, including emergency substitutions
  - Emergency substitutions must use existing substitute players as first response, and contact staff immediately when situation arises
  - All changes must be registered and announced through official Discord
- Roster changes freeze 2 weeks before O.W.L.s conclusion
- N.E.W.T.s roster must be subset of O.W.L.s roster

*Note: LEAGUE7 uses a flexible roster system - We only maintain a list of all registered team players. There is no distinction between starters and substitutes. Captains can freely select any registered players for each game. No need to declare player roles or game lineups in advance*

### 3.2 Division Structure

#### Regional Divisions Contingency
- Regional divisions will be formed if team count exceeds manageable limit for timeline
- Implementation may depend on game features (such as server selection) and network stability
- Teams are assigned to divisions based on:
  - Team region preferences
  - Number of players in each region
  - Team time zone distribution
  - Need for balanced division sizes

*Note: Division structure may change between seasons as game features develop. Region-locked grand divisions may be implemented if server selection becomes available and network stability requires it.*

## 4. O.W.L.s 

### 4.1 Match Format
- Teams play against all other teams in the division (round robin format)
- Each match is best-of-3 games, winning two games secures victory
- Teams must complete at least one match every week
- Teams may schedule up to two matches per week with Staff approval

### 4.2 Match Scheduling
- Both team captains must confirm schedule agreements in writing on LEAGUE7's official Discord
- Teams must complete schedule agreement by Wednesday of the match week
- Default match times for Season 1 (effective after January 6th):
  - East Division: Saturday, 12:00 PM Pacific Time
  - West Division: Sunday, 12:00 PM Pacific Time
- Default times apply only when:
  - Captains cannot agree on a time by Wednesday of the round's week
  - This applies to initial scheduling only, not rescheduling
- Originally scheduled times take precedence over default times
- If captains cannot agree on a match time, the captains need to let Staff know about the situation.
  - Non-responsive team(s) may be treated as if declaring a forfeit. 

### 4.3 Scoring System
- Teams are ranked by match series won
  - Example: Winning a best-of-3 series counts as 1 match win
- When teams have equal match series wins, the following tiebreakers apply in order:
  1. Total game wins: All individual games won across all series
      - *Example:* Team A (2-0, 2-1, 1-2) has 5 game wins
  2. Game Win Rate: (Games Won / Total Games Played) × 100
      - *Example:* Team A won 5 games out of 7 = 71.4%
  3. Point Differential: Sum of all score differences across all games
      - *Example:* Winning games by (+30, +20, -10) = +40 total
- If there is still a tie, staff will offer resolution options (in order):
  1. Teams available: Play tiebreaker match within 48 hours
  2. Teams agree: Follow captains' mutual decision
  3. No agreement/availability: Staff conducts coin flip


### 4.4 Grading Scale
| Grade | Standing | Team Percentage |
|-------|:--------:|:---------------:|
| Outstanding (O) | Top | 10% |
| Exceeds Expectations (E) | Upper | 20% |
| Acceptable (A) | Middle | 30% |
| Poor (P) | Lower | 20% |
| Dreadful (D) | Bottom | 10% |
| Troll (T) | Lowest | 10% |

*Note: Grades are a fun classification inspired by the Harry Potter universe and do not affect advancement. They will be used for historical tracking and community events.*

## 5. N.E.W.T.s

### 5.1 Advancement Requirements
- The 7 highest-ranked teams advance based on O.W.L.s ranking using the following criteria:
  1. Match series wins
  2. Total game wins across all series
  3. Game Win Rate: (Games Won / Total Games Played) × 100
  4. Point Differential: Sum of all score differences across all games
- The 8th spot (Wildcard/Howler) is determined by:
  1. Team with least number of forfeits among remaining teams
  2. If teams are tied on number of forfeits, highest point differential in scored games
  3. If still tied:
     - Higher position in original O.W.L.s standings
     - Total points scored in all games
     - Head-to-head record during O.W.L.s
- In case of multiple divisions:
  - Even distribution of top teams from each division advances
  - Example: In a 2-division format:
    - Top 3 teams from each division advance automatically
    - 1 Wildcard/Howler spot determined using criteria above
    - If divisions have uneven sizes, advancement numbers may be adjusted proportionally
- All advancing teams must:
  - Maintain minimum roster requirements
  - Have no outstanding rule violations
  - Use only players who were on their O.W.L.s roster

### 5.2 Tournament Format

where, <br>
