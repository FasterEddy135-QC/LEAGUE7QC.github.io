We're excited to launch our first season: **<span style="color:#ca1619">Defence Against the Dark Arts</span>**!

This season marks the beginning of 6v6 competitive Quidditch Champions history, featuring an exciting format that combines intense regular season matches (O.W.L.s) with a high-stakes playoff tournament (N.E.W.T.s). Every match counts, every point matters, and legends will be made.
