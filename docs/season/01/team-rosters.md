Check out the teams already registered to compete in Defence Against the Dark Arts Season! Registrations are still open, so there's still time to join the fun!

Teams are listed in alphabetical order. Each team roster displays their 6 players in their primary positions (when available), prioritizing: 1 Seeker, 1 Keeper, 1 Beater, and 3 Chasers. Remaining team members can be viewed by clicking the 'see full roster' button below each team. The captain is shown as gold colored.

Please note LEAGUE7 does not require starter or substitue information - teams can use any players from their roster during a match!
