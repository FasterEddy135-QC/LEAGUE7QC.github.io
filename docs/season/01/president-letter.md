### To all of our LEAGUE7 Champions,
Thank you for making this season both a rewarding and informational ride from start to finish. Though not without challenge and imperfection, I want to express my deepest gratitude to all of you who stuck with us from start to finish as we established a competitive league like no other that's just as unique as the game and community it serves.

From an administrative and staffing standpoint, we've learned quite a bit on how to better exercise and optimise the league moving forward and allow for a more rewarding player experience as we kick-off into the next season. It is my hope that the baseline structures we have developed in this season can be refined further to help accommodate all participants and make this community the quintessential hub for our competitive and casual players alike. 

Though I will not be continuing my presidency, I will do what I can to ensure as simple and seamless a transition of seasonal leaders as possible before I step up onto the pitch to experience things from a player's perspective. 

Remember, none of this would be possible without all of you, and I am immensely thankful for the opportunity to put my skills to use during this time and give back where I could. It is my hope that the next President's skillset supersedes my own and that their patience and mindfulness may be of even better service to the community at large.

We have seen many great teams take to the skies this season, and with any luck, even more will join us in our game to chase, beat, keep, and seek the coveted title of our League7 Champions. To players (and staff) old and new, I humbly request you keep the following as you pursue your careers within our humble league:

- **Pursue excellence in all things.** Both on the field and off of it. It is only by undergoing challenges that we progress, develop and improve.

- **Provide for the community as much as it provides for you.** We are all here to enjoy our time together and it's equally as important to view one another as compatriots and peers above all else --regardless of team association and competition.

- **Exercise patience where there is difficulty.** Do your best to assess all avenues of the situation, practice empathy where you can --but not without consideration for responsibility.

- **Continue to build this community.** Reach out to other players, promote the game where you see fit, and bring more people into the league to ensure its longevity well beyond this season and the next. With any luck, we can keep Quidditch Champions on the market and make it just as viable a competitive e-sport as the next.

- **Enjoy yourselves.** Whether it be as administration, staff, moderator, captain, or player, do not let the responsibilities of participation outweigh the enjoyment of the game on the whole. LEAGUE7 is first and foremost an avenue for fun and organised competition. Always keep that in mind.

Though I am sure I have overlooked quite a bit, I feel secure enough in my efforts to say I have done what I can and where I can to see our community through this season and look forward to the next! 

Good luck my Champions and see you on the pitch!

â€” *Sir Felix (Virtual Witchcraft), Season 1 President of LEAGUE7*
