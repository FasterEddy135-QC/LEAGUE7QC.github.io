### Hi there! 

I'm Melanore, and I've got some exciting news to share. 

I've just started a new league for [Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions](https://www.quidditchchampions.com/en-us), and I'd love for you to be a part of it. For those who like their info quick and snappy, here's the **TLDR**: 

We'll have a president (you'll vote for them), some staff members to keep things running smoothly, and a council of team captains. I'll be in the background, making sure the system works properly. We need 6+ teams to get the ball rolling. Everyone gets a say in big decisions and rule changes. The key? Play fair, be kind, and most importantly, have fun!

Curious for more? Here's the full story:

I've put a lot of thought into creating rules that ensure fair play and a great experience for everyone. While I won't be running the day-to-day operations, I'll be there to make sure these rules are followed and stay transparent. *I need to take your trust for granted.* But here's the deal - if you spot any issues with the rules or think I am missing something crucial, speak up! Your input is what will make this league distinguished.

Now, I'll be honest with you - I'm not concerned about whether this league becomes something big or remains short-termed. I'm genuinely excited either way. If it grows big, I've got no problem stepping back and handing the reins to folks who are even more passionate, since I'll have already set up a solid system. If it stays small, that's fine too. My goal is simple - to create a league where we can all enjoy this game we love, make some great memories, and have a blast doing it.

I'm currently not planning on any advertisements, it'll just be a friendly environment where people join through word-of-mouth. If you're reading this, thank the person who sent you the link. If you send it to another friend, appreciated.

That's all for now. If you're interested in joining or have any questions, just let me know.

Thank you for your time.
