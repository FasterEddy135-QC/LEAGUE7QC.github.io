# Discord/Twitch Moderation Rules & Guidelines

## 1. Introduction

These guidelines ensure fair and consistent moderation in the LEAGUE7 Discord server. All moderators must adhere to these rules to maintain a positive community environment and prevent individual bias or conflict.

## 2. General Principles

- Treat all members with respect and professionalism
- Communicate clearly and impartially with all community members
- Document all moderation actions in the designated #issued-actions channel
- Consult with other moderators when unsure about a situation
- Respect member privacy and never share personal information

## 3. Communication Guidelines

### 3.1 Text Chat Protocol

- Conduct all official communications regarding warnings, infractions, timeouts, and appeals through the ticket system
- Use DMs only to notify users of new tickets or updates, with content identical to the ticket information
- Do not consider DM discussions as official or use them as proof in moderation decisions
- Ensure all moderation-related discussions and decisions are transparent and documented in appropriate channels or tickets

### 3.2 Voice Chat Guidelines

- Moderators do not intervene in personal disputes or complaints about individuals in voice chats
- Members are encouraged to use Discord's built-in features to manage their voice chat experience:
  - Mute individuals they don't wish to hear
  - Use locked rooms for private conversations
- We remind members that there is no way to verify or act on complaints about voice chat behavior unless it violates other server rules (e.g., hate speech, threats) and is reported with evidence

## 4. Infraction Categories

### 4.1 Minor Infractions

- Occasional use of inappropriate language
- Mild spam (e.g., posting the same message 3-5 times)
- Minor arguments or disagreements that don't escalate
- Excessive self-promotion or advertising

### 4.2 Moderate Violations

- Repeated minor infractions after warnings
- Mild forms of harassment or bullying
- Sharing of inappropriate content
- Persistent unwanted competitive banter or criticism of another player or team
- Discussing topics that might breach NDA

### 4.3 Severe Violations

- Hate speech or discriminatory language
- Severe harassment or bullying
- Doxxing or sharing personal information of others
- Making violent threats
- Attempting to raid or spam the server
- Impersonating staff or other members
- Attempting to evade moderation (e.g., rejoining on an alt account after a timeout)

## 5. Moderation Actions

### 5.1 Warnings

#### 5.1.1 Warnings in Common Areas
- Issue for minor infractions or first-time offenses
- Clearly explain the rule violation and expected behavior in the channel where it occurred
- Document the warning in the #moderation-log channel

#### 5.1.2 Ticket Warnings
- Issue for repeated minor infractions or moderate violations
- Open a ticket and ping the user
- Send warning details through the ticket system
- Document the warning in the #moderation-log channel

### 5.2 Three Strikes System

#### 5.2.1 Purpose
- The Three Strikes system is intended to provide a framework for prompt and transparent handling of repeated serious violations of the LEAGUE7 Code of Conduct by members of the community
- Members who commit moderate or severe infractions of the LEAGUE7 Code of Conduct may, depending on Moderator discretion, receive "strikes" which carry a defined penalty

#### 5.2.2 Procedure for Handling Moderate/Severe Infractions
- Apply a timeout to the member according to the guidelines in [5.3.2 Timeout Durations](#532-timeout-durations), open a ticket and ping the user
- Send the details of the infraction through the ticket system and the penalty to be applied
- Notify relevant parties if the user is part of a team or a member of the Captains' Council by adding them to the ticket.
- Penalties may be any combination of:
  - Timeout
  - Prohibition on participating in LEAGUE7 activities for a set number of OWLs/NEWTs matches and/or a set number of days (requires approval of President to become effective)
  - Assessment of one strike for moderate infractions or up to three strikes for severe infractions (requires approval of President to become effective)
  - A permanent ban from the LEAGUE7 Discord server and prohibition from participating in any LEAGUE7 activities (requires approval of President to become effective)
- Penalties applied by a Moderator and automatically by the Three Strikes system shall be considered to run concurrently, e.g. if a moderator applies a timeout of 7 days and a strike for a moderate infraction which carries an automatic penalty of a 2-7 day timeout, the timeout duration shall only be 7 days 
- Should the penalty include the assessment of strike(s) or a prohibition in competing in LEAGUE7 events or matches for a defined time/number of games, ping the President for approval
- Upon the approval of a strike being assessed, the member shall be advised of the number of strikes they have accrued and the penalty incurred
- Advise the member who committed the infraction of their right to appeal via the [appeal process](#7-appeal-process).
- Log the moderaton action in the #issued-actions channel.

#### 5.2.3 Three Strikes Defined Penalties & Removal of Strikes
- Members of the community who receive strikes shall have the following penalties automatically applied:
  - 1 Strike: the member shall receive a temporary server timeout/ban between 2-7 days.
  - 2 Strikes: the member shall receive a temporary server timeout/ban of 30 days and shall be prohibited from participating in LEAGUE7 matches or events for that same period.
  - 3 Strikes: the member shall be permanently banned from all LEAGUE7 community spaces and prohibited from participating in any LEAGUE7 events or matches upon the President's approval.
    - If the President does not wish to approve a permanent ban, they may implement a penalty more severe than the penalty specified for 2 strikes, but less than a permanent ban.
- Should a member have accrued strikes, one strike shall be removed from their record for every consecutive 180 days of good behavior, defined as the member not accruing any further warnings or penalty of any sort.

### 5.3 Timeouts

#### 5.3.1 When to Use Timeouts
- After a warning for continued minor infractions
- For any moderate/severe infractions

#### 5.3.2 Timeout Durations
- For a single minor infraction, the timeout duration shall be left to Moderator discretion, but shall be no less than 1 hour and no more than 48 hours
- For a single moderate infraction or multiple minor infractions, the timeout duration shall be left to Moderator discretion, but shall be no less than 2 days and no more than 7 days
- For multiple moderate infractions or a single severe infraction, the timeout durations shall be left to Moderator discretion, but shall be no less than 7 days.

### 5.4 Prohibitions on Participating in LEAGUE7 Activities

#### 5.4.1 When to Use Prohibitions on Participating in LEAGUE7 Activities
- For any severe infractions
- For moderate infractions which disrupt the community or repeated moderate infractions.

#### 5.4.2 Prohibitions on Participating in LEAGUE7 Activities Durations
- Moderators have discretion when applying prohibitions on participating in LEAGUE7 activities, but the duration should be in proportion to the severity of the infraction and the history of the member who committed the infraction.
- The President's approval is required before this penalty becomes effective. The member may participate in scheduled LEAGUE7 events until the penalty is approved.
- The President may opt to decrease the duration of the penalty applied by the Moderators, but may never increase it.


## 6. Timeout Roles

### 6.1 "Timed Out" Role
- This role is used for regular timeouts
- It prevents users from writing in general chat channels
- Users with this role can won't be able to see messages, however still participate in tickets

### 6.2 "Extended Timeout" Role
- This role is used for extended timeouts
- It has the same restrictions as the "Timed Out" role but is used for longer durations
- Moderators should regularly review users with this role to ensure timely removal

### 6.3 Role Management
- Assign and remove timeout roles manually (A bot for scheduled removal is under development)
- This system ensures that timeout roles do not interfere with a user's ability to participate in tickets or appeals

## 7. Appeal Process

### 7.1 How to Appeal
- Inform users they can appeal moderation actions by opening a new ticket or responding to their existing moderation ticket
- In rare circumstances, if a user and unable to access the ticket system, they can reach out to another moderator via DMs
- Moderators must create a ticket on behalf of the user if an appeal is received, posting the exact text from the user

### 7.2 Appeal Review
1. A moderator not involved in the original action must review the appeal
2. Consult the #moderation-log and any relevant chat logs
3. Discuss the case with other moderators if necessary

### 7.3 Appeal Decision
- Decide to uphold, modify, or lift the moderation action
- Inform the user of the decision and reasoning via ticket
- Document the decision in the #moderation-log channel

## 8. Moderator Accountability

- All moderation actions are subject to review by the President
- Moderators who consistently violate these guidelines may have their permissions revoked
- Address conflicts between moderators privately and escalate to the President if necessary

## 9. Regular Review

- Review and update these guidelines quarterly
- All moderators must acknowledge and agree to any changes

Remember, the goal of moderation is to maintain a positive community environment while preserving the integrity of team participation and league operations. Always err on the side of caution and consult with fellow moderators when in doubt.
