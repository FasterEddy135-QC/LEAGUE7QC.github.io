# Discord Moderation Rules & Guidelines

## 1. Introduction

These guidelines ensure fair and consistent moderation in the LEAGUE7 Discord server. All moderators must adhere to these rules to maintain a positive community environment and prevent individual bias or conflict.

## 2. General Principles

- Treat all members with respect and professionalism
- Communicate clearly and impartially with all community members
- Document all moderation actions in the designated #moderation-log channel
- Consult with other moderators when unsure about a situation
- Respect member privacy and never share personal information

## 3. Communication Guidelines

### 3.1 Text Chat Protocol

- Conduct all official communications regarding warnings, infractions, timeouts, and appeals through the ticket system
- Use DMs only to notify users of new tickets or updates, with content identical to the ticket information
- Do not consider DM discussions as official or use them as proof in moderation decisions
- Ensure all moderation-related discussions and decisions are transparent and documented in appropriate channels or tickets

### 3.2 Voice Chat Guidelines

- Moderators do not intervene in personal disputes or complaints about individuals in voice chats
- Members are encouraged to use Discord's built-in features to manage their voice chat experience:
  - Mute individuals they don't wish to hear
  - Use locked rooms for private conversations
- We remind members that there is no way to verify or act on complaints about voice chat behavior unless it violates other server rules (e.g., hate speech, threats) and is reported with evidence

## 4. Infraction Categories

### 4.1 Minor Infractions

- Occasional use of inappropriate language
- Mild spam (e.g., posting the same message 3-5 times)
- Minor arguments or disagreements that don't escalate
- Excessive self-promotion or advertising

### 4.2 Moderate Violations

- Repeated minor infractions after warnings
- Mild forms of harassment or bullying
- Sharing of inappropriate content
- Persistent unwanted competitive banter or criticism of another player
- Discussing topics that might breach NDA

### 4.3 Severe Violations

- Hate speech or discriminatory language

## 6. Timeout Roles

### 6.1 "Timed Out" Role
- This role is used for regular timeouts
- It prevents users from writing in general chat channels
- Users with this role can won't be able to see messages, however still participate in tickets

### 6.2 "Extended Timeout" Role
- This role is used for extended timeouts
- It has the same restrictions as the "Timed Out" role but is used for longer durations
- Moderators should regularly review users with this role to ensure timely removal

### 6.3 Role Management
- Assign and remove timeout roles manually (A bot for scheduled removal is under development)
- This system ensures that timeout roles do not interfere with a user's ability to participate in tickets or appeals

## 7. Appeal Process

### 7.1 How to Appeal
- Inform users they can appeal moderation actions by opening a new ticket or responding to their existing moderation ticket
- In rare circumstances, if a user and unable to access the ticket system, they can reach out to another moderator via DMs
- Moderators must create a ticket on behalf of the user if an appeal is received, posting the exact text from the user

### 7.2 Appeal Review
1. A moderator not involved in the original action must review the appeal
2. Consult the #moderation-log and any relevant chat logs
3. Discuss the case with other moderators if necessary

### 7.3 Appeal Decision
- Decide to uphold, modify, or lift the moderation action
- Inform the user of the decision and reasoning via ticket
- Document the decision in the #moderation-log channel

## 8. Moderator Accountability

- All moderation actions are subject to review by the President
- Moderators who consistently violate these guidelines may have their permissions revoked
- Address conflicts between moderators privately and escalate to the President if necessary

## 9. Regular Review

- Review and update these guidelines quarterly
- All moderators must acknowledge and agree to any changes

Remember, the goal of moderation is to maintain a positive community environment while preserving the integrity of team participation and league operations. Always err on the side of caution and consult with fellow moderators when in doubt.
