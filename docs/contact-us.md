## How to Contact Us
Please contact Melanore (Founder) directly for official league business, such as:
- Sponsorships or partnership opportunities
- Outreach and media inquiries
- Legal matters

as they maintain consistent oversight of league operations across seasons.


Please **open a ticket** in our Discord server for season-related matters, such as,
- Current season
- Registrations
- Match scheduling
- Technical issues
- General inquiries

This ensures your inquiry is properly tracked and handled by our active staff team.

>Season-related inquiries are directed to our ticket system because our President and Staff positions are elected roles that change periodically. This ensures your inquiry will always reach our current active administration team.
