# Regular Seasonal Guidelines

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive structure, rules, and guidelines that govern LEAGUE7 operations. Our league is designed to provide a challenging, fair, and exciting competitive environment for players of all skill levels, while fostering a strong sense of community among Quidditch Champions players.

LEAGUE7 operates in alignment with the official seasons of Quidditch Champions, ensuring that our competition remains fresh and relevant to the game's evolving meta. Each LEAGUE7 season is divided into two phases: the O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels), which serve as our qualifying round, and the N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test), where the top teams compete for the championship.

The following guidelines have been carefully crafted to ensure a balanced, competitive, and enjoyable experience for all participants. Please read through these rules thoroughly and join us in creating a fun league experience.

## 2. Seasonal Structure

### 2.1 Season Duration

- Each season will follow the official Quidditch Champions season schedule (expected to be approximately 4 months)

- N.E.W.T.s (Phase 2): Classic league for top teams

### 3.2 Phase 1: O.W.L.s (Points-based Ranking Games)

- Each team will play against every other team **once**
- Games will be scheduled by Staff in consultation with the Captains' Council 
- Points will be accumulated based on points scored in matches (with a maximum of 100 points per match)
- Winners will gain an additional 55 points (amount is subject to change, see #active-dicussions)
- Scores will be determined by the total points a team has earned
- In case of a tie in total points, the following tiebreakers will be applied in order:
  1. Total number of wins
  2. Head-to-head record (if applicable)
  3. Total scores difference (points scored minus points conceded)

### 3.3 Grading and Advancement

- At the conclusion of the O.W.L.s phase, teams are ranked based on their total points
- Grades are then assigned to teams as follows:
    - Top 10%: Outstanding (O)
    - Next 20%: Exceeds Expectations (E)
    - Next 30%: Acceptable (A)
    - Next 20%: Poor (P)
    - Next 10%: Dreadful (D)
    - Bottom 10%: Troll (T)
- Advancement to N.E.W.T.s phase:
    1. All teams with O and E grades automatically advance
    2. If additional spots remain, A grade teams will be considered in order of their ranking
    3. Teams with P, D, or T grades do not advance to N.E.W.T.s under any circumstances
- The N.E.W.T.s phase will always consist of 7 teams. The advancement process is as follows:
    - If there are 7 or fewer O and E grade teams, all of them advance
    - If there are more than 7 O and E grade teams, only the top 7 advance
    - If there are fewer than 7 O and E grade teams, the highest-ranked A grade teams will fill the remaining spots
- In case of ties at grade boundaries:
    1. Apply the tiebreakers listed in Section 3.2
    2. If ties persist, Staff will consult with the Captains' Council to determine the fairest resolution

### 3.4 Phase 2: N.E.W.T.s (Classic League for Top Teams)

- Each team will play against every other team twice (home and away)
- Best-of-3 matches for both (home and away)
