# LEAGUE7 Seasons Official Rules

> ### Important Notice
This document provides the initial framework for LEAGUE7 operations before the Captains' Council formation. Following team registrations and Council formation, amendments can be made through the rule change process detailed in the Organizational Guidelines.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
LEAGUE7 provides a structured competitive environment for Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions players of all skill levels. These guidelines establish the rules and framework to ensure fair competition while building a strong community.

### 1.2 Season Structure Overview
Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions runs approximately 2-month seasons (estimated based on Season 1 arrival date). LEAGUE7 extends this to trimester-based seasons for more comprehensive competition, while keeping the names in alignment with the official seasons on the start dates.

Each LEAGUE7 season is divided into two phases:
- O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels): Qualifying round using round-robin format
- N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests): Top teams compete in a double-elimination tournament

## 2. Season Organization and Registration

### 2.1 Season Timeline and Structure

#### 2.1.1 Season Duration
Each season spans approximately three months:
- 2 weeks for team registration and preparation
- 8-15 weeks for O.W.L.s matches (depends on number of teams)
- 2 weeks for N.E.W.T.s matches
- 1-2 weeks break before next season

#### 2.1.2 Minimum Requirements
- The league will officially begin when at least 7 teams have registered to participate
- If 5-7 teams register by the deadline:
  - A pre-season exhibition period will be held to attract more teams
  - This period will last up to 1 month
  - If 7 teams are not registered by the end of this period, the league start will be postponed

### 2.2 Registration Process and Team Requirements

#### 2.2.1 Registration Timeline
- Team registration ends one week before season start
  - This time cannot be shortened to allow time for Captains' Council discussions
- Each team needs:
  - A captain who owns team branding rights 
  - A roster of registered players
  - Additional requirements will be listed on registration forms

#### 2.2.2 Roster Management
- Minimum: 6 players
- Maximum: 9 players
- Teams must maintain minimum roster size throughout season
- Players may only compete for one team per season
- Teams may adjust rosters throughout Season 1 
  - This is only allowed for the first season due to uncertainty of the game state
  - Maximum 4 changes allowed after season start date
  - Players cannot rejoin same team in same season
  - 48-hour notice is required before new player's first match
  - All changes must be registered and announced through official Discord

#### 2.2.3 Roster Lock Periods
- Final roster changes deadline: 2 weeks before O.W.L.s conclusion
- N.E.W.T.s roster must be subset of O.W.L.s roster

### 2.3 Division Structure

#### 2.3.1 Primary Format (Estimated format for Season 1)
- All teams compete in a single division (where teams play against every other team at least once)
- Alternative format may be implemented based on total registered teams

#### 2.3.2 Alternative Format: Regional Divisions Contingency
- Regional divisions will be formed if team count exceeds manageable limit for timeline
- Implementation may depend on game features (such as server selection) and network stability
- Teams are assigned to divisions based on:
  - Number of players in each region
  - Team time zone distribution
  - Team scheduling preferences
  - Need for balanced division sizes

*Note: Division structure may change between seasons as game features develop. Region-locked grand divisions may be implemented if server selection becomes available and network stability requires it.*

## 3. Competition Format and Progression

### 3.1 Phase One: O.W.L.s 

#### 3.1.1 Match Format
- Teams play against all other teams in the division (round robin format)
- Each match is best-of-3 games, winning two games secures victory
- Teams must complete at least one match every week
- Teams may schedule up to two matches per week with Staff approval

#### 3.1.2 Match Scheduling
- Both team captains must confirm schedule agreements in writing on LEAGUE7's official Discord 
- If captains cannot agree on a match time, the default gameplay time will be used as fallback time
- Default gameplay time will be determined by a Captain's Council vote at the start of the season
    - For single division: 12:00 PM PST on either Saturday or Sunday
    - For EU/NA divisions: 8:00 PM CET/CST on either Saturday or Sunday
    - For other variations: Staff will provide suitable fallback options for voting 
- Schedule conflict resolution:
  1. Teams must first attempt direct negotiation
  2. If no agreement within 48 hours, Staff mediates and may assign default time
  3. If a team fails to show up at the assigned fallback time, the team automatically forfeits the match

#### 3.1.3 Scoring and Rankings
- Points are awarded according to:
  - Match victory (winning 2 games): 3 points
  - Match loss: 0 points
- Teams are ranked by total points earned. 
- Tiebreakers apply in order:
  1. Last played direct match results between tied teams 
  2. Percentage of total games won  
  3. Game win rate in matches between tied teams
  4. If two teams available within 48 hours, a new tiebreaker match will be played
  5. Highest point differential scored in games (calculated from the first 2 matches per bo3 of all O.W.L.s games)
  6. Staff-supervised coin flip

### 3.2 Advancement and Grading

#### 3.2.1 Advancement to N.E.W.T.s 
- The 7 highest-ranked teams advance based on O.W.L.s ranking
- 8th spot (Wildcard) determined by highest point differential scored in matches
  - Calculated from all O.W.L.s matches (only the first 2 matches per bo3 games)
  - Encourages competitive play regardless of standing
  - Tiebreaker: Head-to-head record, then total points scored

#### 3.2.2 Grading Scale

| Acceptable (A) | Middle | 30% |
| Poor (P) | Lower | 20% |
| Dreadful (D) | Bottom | 10% |
| Troll (T) | Lowest | 10% |

*Note: Grades are a fun classification inspired by the Harry Potter universe and do not affect advancement. The top 7 teams in the standings will advance regardless of their grade. The wildcard team will hold its original grade letter. Grades will be used for historical tracking of team/player performances and fun league rankings such as 'Outstanding Players' league, 'Troll Division' showmatches, and other future community events inspired by the Wizarding World.*

### A.3 Tiebreaker Example
*This example demonstrates how tied teams are ranked, following the tiebreaker process in order.*

#### Scenario: End of O.W.L.s Tie
The Braga Broomfleet and Bigonville Bombers are tied with these stats:

| Team | Points | W | L | PF | PA | DIFF |
|:-----|:------:|:-:|:-:|:--:|:--:|:----:|
| Braga Broomfleet | 27 | 9 | 5 | 1140 | 960 | +180 |
| Bigonville Bombers | 27 | 9 | 5 | 1100 | 1000 | +100 |

Tiebreaker Process:
1. Direct match results between tied teams:
    - Braga Broomfleet vs Bigonville Bombers head-to-head match:
      - Braga won 2-1 in games
      - Result: Braga Broomfleet ranks higher

**If** for some reason teams had split their matches, next tiebreakers would apply:

2. Percentage of total games won:
    - Braga: 20 games won out of 30 played (66.7%)
    - Bigonville: 19 games won out of 30 played (63.3%)
    - Result: Braga would still rank higher
3. Game win rate in matches between tied teams would be next
4. Tiebreaker match if teams available within 48 hours
5. Highest point differential would advance if teams are not available
6. If still ties, staff-supervised coin flip as final resort

*Note: In this case, the first tiebreaker (head-to-head) was sufficient to determine the final ranking.*
