# Example Scenarios

This document illustrates how LEAGUE7 operates using two example scenarios: 
- a 20-team regular structure, and
- a 30-team expanded structure. 

These scenarios demonstrate the league's adaptability and commitment to fair, exciting competition.

## Scenario 1: 20-Team Regular Structure

Imagine LEAGUE7 has just opened registrations for its *Defense Against the Dark Arts* season on December, 2024. Assume 20 teams have signed up. After the deadline the Staff creates a 10-week schedule for the O.W.L.s. 

### O.W.L.s Phase

Each team will face every other team once, resulting in 19 matches per team, expecting 2 matches to be played each week. Teams like the Thunderbirds and Phoenix Flames quickly establish themselves as frontrunners, while others like the Flobberworm Crawlers struggle to find their rhythm.

As the dust settles after the final O.W.L.s match, the Staff tallies the points and assigns grades:

| Rank | Team | Points | Grade | Advance to N.E.W.T.s |
|:----:|:-----|:------:|:------:|--------------------:|
| 1    | Thunderbirds | 850 | O | Yes |
| 2    | Phoenix Flames | 820 | O | Yes |
| 3    | Basilisk Strikers | 795 | E | Yes |
| 4    | Hippogriff Flyers | 780 | E | Yes |
| 5    | Manticore Maulers | 765 | E | Yes |

| 10   | Mermaid Divers | 690 | A | No |
| 11   | Goblin Goldminers | 675 | A | No |
| 12   | Unicorn Chargers | 660 | A | No |
| 13   | Werewolf Pack | 645 | P | No |
| 14   | Dementor's Kiss | 630 | P | No |
| 15   | Banshee Screamers | 615 | P | No |
| 16   | Giant Stompers | 600 | P | No |
| 17   | Kelpie Riders | 585 | D | No |
| 18   | Gnome Gardeners | 570 | D | No |
| 19   | Bowtruckle Branch | 555 | T | No |
| 20   | Flobberworm Crawlers | 540 | T | No |

Grading breakdown:
- Top 2 teams (10%): Outstanding (O)
- Next 4 teams (20%): Exceeds Expectations (E)
- Next 6 teams (30%): Acceptable (A)
- Next 4 teams (20%): Poor (P)
- Next 2 teams (10%): Dreadful (D)
- Bottom 2 teams (10%): Troll (T)

### Advancement to N.E.W.T.s

The top 7 teams advance to the N.E.W.T.s phase:
1. Thunderbirds (O)
2. Phoenix Flames (O)
3. Basilisk Strikers (E)
4. Hippogriff Flyers (E)
5. Manticore Maulers (E)
6. Dragon Tamers (E)
7. Pixie Tricksters (A)

### N.E.W.T.s Phase

The N.E.W.T.s phase is even more intense, with each team playing every other team twice. After 6 weeks of thrilling matches:

| Rank | Team | Wins | Losses | Points |
|:----:|:-----|:----:|:------:|:------:|
| 1    | Phoenix Flames | 10 | 2 | 30 |
| 2    | Thunderbirds | 9 | 3 | 27 |

Final Results:
- Champion: Phoenix Flames
- Runner-up: Thunderbirds
- Third Place: Basilisk Strikers

## Scenario 2: 30-Team Expanded League

In the following season, assume LEAGUE7's popularity increases, and 30 teams register. The Staff decides to implement the expanded structure, dividing the teams into two independent divisions of 15 teams each.

### O.W.L.s Phase

Over 10 weeks, teams in each division compete fiercely. The Gryffindor Lions dominate Division 1, while the Holyhead Harpies lead the charge in Division 2. At the end of the O.W.L.s phase, the standings look like this:
