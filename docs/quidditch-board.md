##  About
Welcome to the Quidditch Board, an interactive tool designed to help you visualize and strategize player positions on the field. Feel free to explore and strategize your matches using the Quidditch Board!

> Note: This feature is still work in progress.

## Instructions

- Use the team selectors labeled "Team 1 (White)" and "Team 2 (Gold)" to choose your teams. 
   - Each player is assigned a role based on their primary position. 
   - Click on a player's name in the roster to toggle them as active or inactive (useful when multiple players are available for a single role).
   - Inactive players are displayed with a strikethrough and reduced opacity.
- Select "Default" to populate a basic lineup.
- Click and drag players within the field to customize their positions.


## Whatâ€™s Coming Next?
We are planning to improve the Quidditch Board to provide a richer and more immersive experience. Here are the upcoming features we're working on as we find time, in order of priority:

- Side view for height simulation: Visualize player positions in three dimensions, including height.
- Toggleable area indicators: Display zones such as the keeper's power kick range and the deadzone.
- Draggable balls: Addition of snitch, bludher, or even chaser-attachable quaffle to create dynamic plays.
- Rotatable brooms: Enable clearer simulation of player orientation and movement.
