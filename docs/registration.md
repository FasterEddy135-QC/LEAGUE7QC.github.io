# Registration
> Official team registration forms are available here. Please review requirements before submitting.

## Requirements
1. Teams must have a minimum of 3 players on their roster.
2. Each team must designate a captain.
3. The team captain should be active to participate in the Captains' Council decisions.
4. Players cannot be registered on multiple teams within the same cup.
5. ~~Teams must provide a complete roster of players at the time of registration.~~ <span style="color:#ffbd00">(see below)</span>
6. All participating team members must be present in the Discord server.
7. Teams should be prepared to participate for the full duration of the cup (6 months).
8. Teams should be able to field the minimum required number of players for scheduled matches to avoid forfeits.
9. Teams must agree to adhere to the league's code of conduct and gameplay rules.
10. Teams must be willing to reapply for each new season, even if they participated in the previous one.

While not explicitly stated as a requirement, it's recommended that teams have 5-7 players to account for potential scheduling issues.

<span style="color:#ffbd00">OVERRULE:</span> Due to the game not being released yet and uncertainty among potential players, **requirement #5** is overruled by the Founder for the first season only. Teams may apply with a minimum of 3 players and will be allowed to increase their roster size after initial registration. This exception is to accommodate those who are still uncertain about their participation. Regular roster rules will apply in subsequent seasons.
